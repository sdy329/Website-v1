                <p className="mb-4">In 2013, I decided to join a VEX Robotics team through my school. This decision started an eventful journey that inevitably helped me find my calling. Initially driven by the idea of becoming a mechanical engineer, I quickly realized my passion for programming. This spark has guided me throughout my academic & robotic endeavors over the years.</p>
                <p className="">A few accomplishments I am proud to share:</p>
